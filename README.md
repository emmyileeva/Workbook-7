## ✅ Exercises Included

### 🔍 Basic Queries
- Created folder: `basic-queries`
- Practiced simple `SELECT` queries
- Used `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, `LIMIT`, and `DISTINCT`
- Focused on retrieving data from core tables like `Products`, `Orders`, and `Customers`

### 📊 Aggregates & Grouping
- Created folder: `aggregates-and-grouping`
- Practiced aggregation functions: `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MAX`, `MIN`
- Grouped data using `GROUP BY`
- Filtered groups with `HAVING`
- Analyzed sales totals, order quantities, and customer activity

### 🔁 Nested Queries
- Created folder: `nested-queries`
- Wrote subqueries in `SELECT` and `WHERE` clauses
- Found the most expensive products and related categories
- Identified orders involving specific products or shipping companies
- Queried employee and customer info for specific order IDs

### 🔗 Joins
- Created folder: `joins`
- Practiced `INNER JOIN` across tables like `Products`, `Suppliers`, `Categories`, `Orders`, and `Shippers`
- Combined data to view full product info with supplier and category
- Found orders involving specific products and countries
- Used subqueries alongside joins for more complex results

## 🧠 Reflection

These exercises helped reinforce key SQL concepts like:

- Designing normalized relational queries
- Writing nested subqueries and multi-table joins
- Aggregating and filtering data with real business use cases
- Using SQL to both analyze and manipulate data

Each exercise improved my understanding of how SQL supports real-world data needs — from simple lookups to dynamic, multi-layered reports.
